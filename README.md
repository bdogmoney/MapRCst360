#  Customer 360 Powered by MapR&trade;

The <a href="https://mapr.com/products/mapr-converged-data-platform/">MapR Converged Data Platform</a> is uniquely suited to run Customer 360 applications because of its ability to host data lakes containing structured and unstructured data, integrate data sets, and run operational and analytical workloads simultaneously. MapR enables applications to glean customer intelligence through machine learning that relates to customer personality, sentiment, propensity to buy, and likelihood to churn. Check out the <a href="https://mapr.com/solutions/quickstart/customer-360-knowing-your-customer-is-step-one/">Customer 360 Quick Start Solution</a> to learn more about MapR's products and solutions for Customer 360 applications.

This demo application focuses on showing how the following three tenants to customer 360 applications can be achieved on MapR:

1. Big Data storage of structured and semi-structured data in files, tables, and streams
2. SQL-based data integration of disperate datasets
3. Predictive analytics through machine learning insights

## Overview

There are a lot of different ways to demo MapR. Some people like to use data visualizations and eye candy to convey the value of MapR's technology. Other people like go deep into APIs for more developer oriented conversations. In this demo, we try to accomodate both approaches. For the graphical approach, this demo application runs in a stand-alone web server that shows interactive data visualizations (shown below). For the deep technical dive, we provide Jupyter Notebooks to show code and MapR's APIs.
