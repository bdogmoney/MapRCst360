#  Customer 360 Powered by MapR&trade;

The <a href="https://mapr.com/products/mapr-converged-data-platform/">MapR Converged Data Platform</a> is uniquely suited to run Customer 360 applications because of its ability to host data lakes containing structured and unstructured data, integrate data sets, and run operational and analytical workloads simultaneously. MapR enables applications to glean customer intelligence through machine learning that relates to customer personality, sentiment, propensity to buy, and likelihood to churn. Check out the <a href="https://mapr.com/solutions/quickstart/customer-360-knowing-your-customer-is-step-one/">Customer 360 Quick Start Solution</a> to learn more about MapR's products and solutions for Customer 360 applications.
